# pattern-fixes
Repairs some of the mistakes in the en-verbs.txt file in the python pattern library.

Go to /pattern/text/en/en-verbs.txt and replace that file with this one. 

The accompanying spreadsheet shows the mistakes in red and the fixes made.
First three columns in the spreadsheet are the correct forms.
Next two columns are the correct form of the simple past and what pattern thought the simple past was.
The last two columns are the same thing for past participles.
